# recruiting-tools-and-stuff
Compilation of all the recruiting and sourcing tools I have picked up along the way all in one place.
Basically just trying to create a repository of recruiting and sourcing tools, sites, tips, tricks so it is all in one place.
If any of this information is helpful to other recruiters, I am all for it. Much of the information is not original and are being added here from other sites.
Use anything at your own risk, I make no claim that the information from/links to other sites is legitimate or would not violate any terms and conditions.
I simply want to create a repository for my own personal use and if it can help anyone else, I am happy to pass on my knowledge.
Any assistance in this endevour is appreciated!
